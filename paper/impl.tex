cuckoo:
order of lookup REALLY matters: reverse order.




cuckoo: each move goes from valid state to valid state with bounded
ops. Worst case the recursive move doesn't complete: still valid.

TXN may be too much overhead. instead, we can use persist-release. We do this
with count, because if the count is off a bit, that's okay. The only time that
happens is power fail, and we can recalculate the count after a fail if we need
it to be perfect.



Calc size of TXNs (# instruction, # of mem access). Also use Os to reduce just
those functions.
